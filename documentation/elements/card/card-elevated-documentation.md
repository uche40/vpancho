### Elevated Card

Vuero cards can be elevated and show a light box shadow.
To display elevated cards, simply add the `is-raised`
class to the target card element.

<!--code-->

```vue
<template>
  <div class="s-card is-raised">
    <h3 class="title is-5">Iam an S-Card</h3>
    <p>
      I can be used as is in any layout. S Cards are simple containers that can
      hold any type of content.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="r-card is-raised">
    <h3 class="title is-5">Iam an R-Card</h3>
    <p>
      I can be used as is in any layout. R Cards are simple containers that can
      hold any type of content.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="l-card is-raised">
    <h3 class="title is-5">Iam an L-Card</h3>
    <p>
      I can be used as is in any layout. L Cards are simple containers that can
      hold any type of content.
    </p>
  </div>
</template>
```
